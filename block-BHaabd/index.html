                        In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats? 
                        In our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and storerooms, our farms,
                         barns, and rickyards, in our docks,our granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets,
                          meat markets, and other places too numerous to mention, how usefulthey are! 
                        InouÂ·ships,however, the rats oft set them   at defiance;still they are of great service.

                             Pericles, Act iii., describes this keen attention of the cat to     its natural pursuit!
